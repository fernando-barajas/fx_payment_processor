# FX Payment Processor

This project is a prototype of a simplified **FX Payment Processor**.
It powers a **multi-currency wallet system** where clients can:

- Fund their wallets in different currencies
- Convert between currencies using FX rates
- Withdraw funds to external bank accounts
- View balances and transaction history

Built with **Ruby on Rails (API-only mode)** and **PostgreSQL**, fully containerized with **Docker**.

---

üîé Assumptions

- A wallet belongs to a user (1-to-1 relationship).
- Only USD and MXN currencies are supported.
- Currency conversions are treated as two transactions:
  - A withdraw from the source currency.
  - A fund in the target currency.
- The system is meant for prototype/testing, so:
  - No pagination is required for listing transactions.
  - Transaction history is expected to be small.
